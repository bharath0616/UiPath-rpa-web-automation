Automated the website which I developed to fetch the api of company. 

This rpa project performs following tasks:
->Signing in
->Scraping the data which is fetched from api by user input.
->Storing it in an excel sheet.
->Signing out.
->Sending the excel sheet through mail to the mentioned users.

UiPath studio is used for automation.
Source code of the developed website is not on github due to company policies.
